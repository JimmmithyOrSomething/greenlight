Today I got a lot done, I first did a lot of research on how a machine like ethis works while figuring out how I would make this on a small budget. Then I did the math behind the amount of photons in a beam of light which ended up being a lot. After that I worked on how to bring that number down. Then I researched the parts I would need to build this and found some good options that should fit into my budget. I found a good light filter that can remove 2^20 times the light as well as a few other tricks that should be helpful. Then I made a circut desigh and wrote a tiny bit of code for it. Normaly I would make a physical version but I didn't have some of the parts so I used tinker cad (which is actualy really good at this type of thing) and it's working fine so far. The code required for this is only a few lines for now beucase it's bascialy just checking for light. For everything is working but I will deffinely need some changees once I have the actual parts.

I have this idea, I wan't to build a quantum random number generator and I think I can do it with an ESP 32 and some off the shelf parts and a PCB. I've always been so interested in the fact that nothing in our world is random and everything is dictated by something so no coin flip can be random. And yet quantum particals don't follow the same rules we have to. So a photon can be in two places at once and that's what this project is going to look at. It's going to work by firing a lazer that is dimmmed to an extream degree at a 50/50 photon splitter which means that every photon has a equal chance of bouncing off or going through. So when one photon hits it it both bounces off and goes though at the same time existing in a superposion. Then when I track what happens with a photo resitor one of those becomes real. On top of this I will make a little coin flip demonstration that shows the result of if it bounced off or not. Making a fully random coin flip.

I named this project greenlight beucause it is a light bassed project (even thought the light will probably be red) And this reminds me of Gatsby looking at the green light across the water. But for me I'm looking at a little glimps of what lies outside our world and how diffrent everything is from how it seems.

For today I just plained out my design and set up my github and named my project
